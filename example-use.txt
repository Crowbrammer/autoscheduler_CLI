/**
 * Current flow:
 * 
 *  - Set the current template X
 *  - Add actions to it X
 *  - Schedule it X (Store the schedule);
 *  - Refer to the schedule whenever
 *  - The current template should be locked
 */

 Modify past schedules...
 Modify current schedules
 Reschedule
 Say why
 Set the outcome
Reorder actions in the template

I can't quickly reschedule at a certain point...
Can't modify the actions of the schedule template... 

Idea: Try it -> Add to todo list -> Test -> Work -> Refactor
