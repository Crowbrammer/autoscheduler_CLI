   generate a new template and schedule from the template, with the first
   action being that linked with the number. Entering '+ <action name> <duration> @2'
   will put it where action #2 is and move the other actions down. It will
   then reschedule it. 
   

/**
 * Current flow:
 * 
 *  - Set the current template X
 *  - Add actions to it X
 *  - Schedule it X (Store the schedule);
 *  - Refer to the schedule whenever
 *  - The current template should be locked
 */

 Modify past schedules...
 Modify current schedules
 Reschedule
 Say why
 Set the outcome
Reorder actions in the template

I can't quickly reschedule at a certain point...
Can't modify the actions of the schedule template... 

Idea: Try it -> Add to todo list -> Test -> Work -> Refactor
